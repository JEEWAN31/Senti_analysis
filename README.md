# Sentimental Analysis
This was a part of a course project under the Andrew N G.
Performed EDA on the Dataset using matplotlib and seaborn libraries followed by further text processing
• Developed a model architecture with 80% testing accuracy to detect real disaster tweets with Logistic Regression
• Used test-train split to compare the training accuracy among different Supervised Machine Learning models such
as textbfLogistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Ridge Classifier and Random Forest Classifier
